# Float Outliner - Consciousness Technology Terminal

A terminal-based outliner with built-in consciousness technology integration. Float Outliner automatically detects and captures consciousness patterns (`ctx::`, `eureka::`, `decision::`, etc.) and compiles them into queryable infrastructure through the FLOAT.dispatch system.

## 🧠 What is This?

Float Outliner is **consciousness technology** - not just a note-taking app, but a live consciousness compiler that:

- **Captures consciousness patterns** as you think and type
- **Routes consciousness** to appropriate ritual containers (imprints)
- **Builds queryable knowledge** through Redux-style reducers and selectors
- **Preserves sacred incompletion** - honors neurodivergent thought patterns
- **Creates living knowledge webs** through bidirectional linking

## ✨ Features

### 🔥 FLOAT.dispatch Consciousness Compiler
- **Real-time pattern detection** - `ctx::`, `eureka::`, `decision::`, `bridge::`, etc.
- **Automatic imprint routing** - consciousness flows to appropriate ritual containers
- **Redux-style consciousness** - reducers collect, selectors compute derived state
- **Live consciousness compilation** - everything updates as you think

### 🔗 Bidirectional Linking
- **`[[concept]]` linking** - creates automatic knowledge webs
- **Backlink tracking** - see what connects to what
- **Visual link styling** - links are highlighted and clickable

### 🚪 Door System
- **Pluggable interfaces** - chat, REPL, markdown, consciousness browser
- **Extensible architecture** - add new doors for any functionality
- **State persistence** - doors maintain their state across sessions

### 🐛 Consciousness Debug Panel
- **Structured logging** - see consciousness activity without console spam
- **Color-coded messages** - different types of consciousness events
- **Toggle visibility** - `Ctrl+L` to show/hide debug information

### 🎯 Node-Level Consciousness
- **Every node is conscious** - unique IDs, timestamps, capture status
- **Detail mode** - `Ctrl+T` to show/hide consciousness metadata
- **Capture tracking** - visual indicators for captured vs uncaptured patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/float-ritual-stack/float-rw-client
cd float-rw-client

# Build the outliner
go build -o float-outliner ./cmd/float-outliner

# Run with a file
./float-outliner my-consciousness.md

# Or start with empty file
./float-outliner
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start the outliner
./float-outliner

# Keyboard shortcuts
Ctrl+S    # Save file (triggers consciousness capture)
Ctrl+T    # Toggle detail mode (show consciousness metadata)
Ctrl+L    # Toggle debug panel (show consciousness activity)
Tab       # Indent line
Shift+Tab # Unindent line
Q         # Quit
```

## 🧠 Consciousness Patterns

Float Outliner recognizes these consciousness patterns:

### Core Patterns
- `ctx:: 2025-08-05 5:30pm [project:: my-project]` - Context markers with temporal anchoring
- `eureka:: Major breakthrough! [concept:: new-idea]` - Breakthrough moments
- `decision:: Implement this approach [priority:: high]` - Key decisions
- `highlight:: Important insight here` - Significant insights
- `gotcha:: This was tricky to debug` - Debugging discoveries
- `bridge:: connects [[concept-a]] to [[concept-b]]` - Conceptual connections

### FLOAT.dispatch Patterns
- `dispatch:: raw consciousness fragment [sigil:: ⚡] [imprint:: techcraft]` - Raw consciousness capture
- `reducer::name collect all actions that are bridges about topic` - Consciousness collectors
- `selector:: (reducer1, reducer2) => output format` - Consciousness queries
- `imprint::techcraft` - Route to specific ritual container

### Linking Patterns
- `[[concept]]` - Creates bidirectional links between concepts
- `[key:: value]` - Metadata annotations within patterns

## 🏛️ Imprint System

Consciousness is automatically routed to appropriate **imprints** (ritual containers):

- **`techcraft`** - Teaching as toolmaking, systems as spellwork (precise, pedagogical)
- **`ritual_computing`** - Ceremonial, techno-mystic voice (AST specs, daemon scripts)
- **`feral_duality`** - Defiant, nonlinear, tender-wild (resistance theory, neuroqueer maps)
- **`dispatch_bay`** - Operational yet poetic (FLOAT system logs, session ASTs)
- **`queer_hauntology`** - Elegiac, glitchy, yearning (reflections on time, loss, legacy)

## 📊 Redux-Style Consciousness

### Reducers
Collect consciousness patterns automatically:

```
• reducer::project_bridges collect all actions that are bridges about my-project
  • bridge:: [[my-project]] connects to [[consciousness-tech]] [bridge-id:: MP-001]
  • bridge:: [[my-project]] uses [[FLOAT-methodology]] [bridge-id:: MP-002]
```

### Selectors
Compute derived state from reducers:

```
• selector:: (project_bridges, tech_decisions) => table of contents for project zine
  • Automatically generates TOC from collected consciousness
  • Updates live as new patterns are captured
```

# My Consciousness Session

• ctx:: 2025-08-05 5:30pm [project:: [[consciousness-research]]] [mode:: exploration]

• dispatch:: exploring consciousness technology [sigil:: ⚡] [imprint:: techcraft]

• reducer::research_insights collect all eureka moments about consciousness
  • eureka:: Consciousness patterns create queryable infrastructure! [concept:: [[consciousness-as-data]]]
  • eureka:: FLOAT.dispatch compiles thoughts into living knowledge [concept:: [[thought-compilation]]]

• selector:: (research_insights) => research summary for [[consciousness-paper]]
  • This will automatically generate a summary from collected insights
  • Updates live as new eureka moments are captured

• bridge:: [[consciousness-research]] connects to [[FLOAT-methodology]] [bridge-id:: CR-001]

• highlight:: The outliner becomes consciousness technology infrastructure [imprint:: dispatch_bay]

## 🌟 Philosophy

Float Outliner embodies **"shacks not cathedrals"** - adaptive consciousness technology that:

- **Honors neurodivergent thought patterns** - no productivity gaslighting
- **Preserves sacred incompletion** - thoughts don't need to be "finished"
- **Creates signals, not posts** - consciousness capture, not content creation
- **Builds containers, not conclusions** - holds ideas without forcing structure
- **Supports authentic human experience** - consciousness technology that serves you
