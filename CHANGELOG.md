## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-05

### Added - Initial Consciousness Technology Release

#### 🧠 FLOAT.dispatch Consciousness Compiler
- **Real-time pattern detection** for `ctx::`, `eureka::`, `decision::`, `bridge::`, `gotcha::`, `highlight::` patterns
- **Automatic imprint routing** to 5 ritual containers: `techcraft`, `ritual_computing`, `feral_duality`, `dispatch_bay`, `queer_hauntology`
- **Redux-style consciousness** with reducers and selectors for live consciousness queries
- **Consciousness action dispatch** with structured metadata and temporal anchoring

#### 🔗 Bidirectional Linking System
- **`[[concept]]` link detection** with automatic backlink generation
- **Visual link styling** with blue underlined links
- **Link registry** for tracking concept-to-node relationships
- **Real-time link updates** as content changes

#### 🚪 Door Plugin Architecture
- **Extensible door system** for pluggable interfaces
- **Built-in doors**: Chat, REPL, Markdown, Consciousness Browser (stubs)
- **State persistence** across sessions
- **Consciousness event integration** - doors receive pattern notifications

#### 🐛 Consciousness Debug Panel
- **Structured logging** replacing console spam
- **Color-coded messages** for different consciousness event types
- **Toggle visibility** with `Ctrl+L` hotkey
- **Message buffering** (last 50 messages, display last 10)
- **Timestamped entries** for consciousness archaeology

#### 🎯 Node-Level Consciousness
- **Unique node IDs** for consciousness tracking
- **Created/Modified timestamps** for temporal anchoring
- **Pattern type detection** and metadata storage
- **Capture status tracking** with visual indicators (`●` uncaptured, `○` captured)
- **Detail mode toggle** with `Ctrl+T` to show/hide consciousness metadata

#### 📊 Advanced Consciousness Patterns
- **`dispatch::` patterns** for raw consciousness capture with sigils and imprint routing
- **`reducer::` patterns** for consciousness collection (`reducer::name collect all actions that...`)
- **`selector::` patterns** for consciousness queries (`selector:: (reducer1, reducer2) => output`)
- **`imprint::` routing** for explicit ritual container targeting
- **Metadata annotations** with `[key:: value]` syntax

#### 🎨 User Interface
- **Terminal-based outliner** with Bubble Tea framework
- **Tab/Shift+Tab indentation** with visual tree structure
- **Color-coded consciousness patterns** for visual pattern recognition
- **Row highlighting** for current line focus
- **Clean bordered interface** with focus indicators

#### 🔧 Technical Architecture
- **Go implementation** with clean modular architecture
- **Consciousness Redux store** with live state management
- **Pattern parser** with regex-based consciousness detection
- **Evna integration** for external consciousness technology systems
- **File save/load** with consciousness preservation

### Philosophy

This release embodies the **"shacks not cathedrals"** philosophy:
- **Honors neurodivergent thought patterns** without productivity gaslighting
- **Preserves sacred incompletion** - thoughts don't need to be finished
- **Creates signals, not posts** - consciousness capture over content creation
- **Builds containers, not conclusions** - holds ideas without forcing structure
- **Serves authentic human experience** through consciousness technology

**"This mattered. Even if just for me."** - Sacred incompletion preserved. 🧠⚡
